# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is one of my very first projects made, it looks very childish and the code may not even work on a few devices as i have used TKinter for UI design, which again failed miserably.
I am uploading this file along with a few other projects I have made over the course of my BTech degree. 
Tic-Tac-Toe is a project I made in my first semester along with my other team members and I have contributed in making a few functions.
